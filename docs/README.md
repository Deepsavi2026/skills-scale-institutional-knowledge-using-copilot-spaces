# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. This README is the central index for our project management processes and provides a short overview of how we initiate, plan, execute, release, and learn from work. Use it as the starting point to find detailed process documents, templates, and checklists in this docs/ folder.

## Brief Overview of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme runs projects with an iterative, customer-first approach that moves work through a clear lifecycle: initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Initiation focuses on a lightweight Project One-pager to capture the problem, objectives, success metrics, stakeholders, and a high-level timeline. Planning breaks approved initiatives into shippable increments, produces a prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria, estimates scope, defines a Definition of Done, and produces a release plan and milestones to keep work aligned to measurable outcomes.

Day-to-day delivery relies on explicit workflows and artifacts to maintain momentum and visibility. Teams use a project board with standard columns (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done) and follow a pull request workflow that favors small PRs, includes issue links and acceptance criteria, runs CI and security scans, and requires peer approval before merging. Execution checklists, dashboards for velocity/burndown, and weekly risk reviews help teams detect and mitigate problems early.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit so ownership and handoffs are clear: Project Managers coordinate schedules, risks, and stakeholder communication; Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize work; Developers implement and test features; QA validates acceptance criteria; and stakeholders provide input and approvals. These role definitions are used in kickoffs, planning sessions, and retrospectives to ensure tasks like risk ownership, release planning, and stakeholder updates have accountable owners.

Communication and quality assurance are built into the cadence and risk practices. Teams run short daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, regular demos, and monthly stakeholder updates. Risk management uses a living Risk Register with clear escalation paths from team -> PM -> Product Lead -> Sponsor. QA practices include unit and integration tests, smoke tests for critical flows, security scanning in CI, and manual QA where necessary; these are enforced via CI gates, acceptance criteria, and pre-release smoke testing.
